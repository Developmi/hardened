## Overview

Developmi Hardened is an Ansible-based infrastructure automation project focused on establishing a secure, auditable, and repeatable baseline across mixed-host environments.

It is designed to standardize the security posture of:

- **Brain nodes** for central services, ingress, and observability.
- **Muscle nodes** for workload execution and optional edge services.
- **Application stacks** under `apps/` are operator-managed and deploy first-class via native Docker Compose (`git pull` + `docker compose up` on `public_net`); Portainer (Edge agent) is an optional manager when `enable_portainer: true` (ADR-07).

The project aligns to **NIST 800-53** controls and emphasizes secrets handling, least privilege, hardened networking, and operational repeatability.

---

## Features

- 🛡️ **Security-first hardening** with SSH restrictions, firewall controls, audit logging, CrowdSec integration, and Vault-backed secrets.
- 🔐 **Zero-trust networking** through Tailscale ACL-driven access and minimized public exposure.
- 🧱 **Modular architecture** using Ansible roles for security, Docker orchestration, observability, compliance, ingress, and Portainer edge operations.
- 📦 **Optional application bundles** for Chatwoot, Metabase, n8n, OpenWebUI, Twenty CRM, and Uptime Kuma.
- 📈 **Operational visibility** with exporter and observability stack support when capacity allows.
- 🧪 **Validation gates** executed through Make targets (uv-backed) for linting, syntax checks, and secret scanning.
- 🧭 **Documented operating model** with commands centralized in `docs/operations/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md`.

---

## Value Snapshot for CTO/CFO

In less than 30 seconds:

- **Cost Control:** Designed for self-hosted operation on VPS/Bare Metal to avoid linear SaaS cost growth.
- **Security Baseline:** NIST-aligned hardening with zero-trust networking and auditable controls.
- **Data Sovereignty:** Sensitive workloads stay in infrastructure you control.
- **Cloud-Exit Ready:** Portable Ansible playbooks and provider-agnostic architecture reduce lock-in.
- **Operational Predictability:** Pull-based management model and Make-driven runbooks reduce change risk.

---

## FinOps Case Study (Nuntu)

This project pattern has been applied to a real-world migration scenario (codenamed **Nuntu**) focused on sovereignty, security, and OpEx reduction.

### Business problem

- SaaS sprawl with linear OpEx growth by headcount.
- Data processed in third-party multi-tenant platforms.
- Vendor/API dependence creating operational fragility.

### Implemented approach

- Sovereign self-hosted stack on high-performance VPS fleet.
- Pull-based operations model (Portainer Edge pattern).
- Caddy + WAF perimeter with hardened default-deny posture.
- Security automation and compliance-oriented runbooks.

### Measured outcomes (reported case)

| Metric                 | Before (SaaS Sprawl) | After (Sovereign Self-Hosted)        | Impact                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Annual Software OpEx   | $X (baseline)        | $0.3X                                | **-70%**                   |
| Platform Uptime (Prod) | ~99.5%               | 99.8%                                | Higher reliability         |
| Data Sovereignty       | 0%                   | 100%                                 | Full control               |
| WAF Efficacy           | N/A                  | >99% block rate, <1% false positives | Enterprise-grade perimeter |
| Incident Response Time | Hours/Days           | Minutes                              | Stronger resilience        |
| Vendor Risk            | Critical             | Negligible                           | Supply-chain risk reduced  |

> **Scope note:** This case study is a field implementation narrative and not a vendor benchmark report. Results depend on workload, architecture, and governance discipline.

## Field Validation Evidence

Current documented execution evidence in this repository corresponds to a lab/staging scope with:

- **1 Brain node**
- **2 Muscle nodes**

This is intentionally presented as operational proof-of-execution while broader fleet rollouts are scheduled.

## Compliance & Standards

This repository is not just "NIST-themed". It includes implementation-grounded compliance references with auditable mappings and evidence workflows.

### Primary control coverage

- **NIST SP 800-53:** AC-2, CM-7, SC-7, SI-4, AU-12, and SC-28 (partial for full disk encryption).
- **NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust):** overlay-network control path, identity/tag-based access, and pull-based management pattern.
- **CIS Level 1 (generic Ubuntu/Debian alignment):** SSH baseline, firewall posture, brute-force mitigation, and audit telemetry.
- **DORA/ENS contextual mapping:** documented as technical-functional alignment for resilience and governance discussions.

### Where to audit compliance details

- Compliance framework status and mapping: [docs/compliance/COMPLIANCE-MAPPING-STATUS.md](docs/compliance/COMPLIANCE-MAPPING-STATUS.md)
- Reproducible evidence workflow: [docs/compliance/evidence/EVIDENCE_MODEL.md](docs/compliance/evidence/EVIDENCE_MODEL.md)

> **Important:** This project provides implementation evidence and technical mappings. Formal certification readiness still requires organization-specific legal, scope, and auditor validation.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- `uv` for Python dependency and environment management.
- Python 3.14 or newer.
- SSH access to the target hosts.
- Ansible Galaxy network access for collection installation.
- Docker Compose only if you plan to run optional app bundles.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Developmi/hardened.git
cd hardened
make sync
make install-collections
```

### Inventory

Create or customize your inventory before deployment:

```ini
[brain]
brain-1 ansible_host=YOUR_PUBLIC_IP ansible_user=root public_ip=YOUR_PUBLIC_IP

[muscle]
muscle-1 ansible_host=YOUR_PUBLIC_IP ansible_user=ubuntu public_ip=YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
```

### Secrets

Populate the SOPS-encrypted secrets file and encrypt it before deployment
(SOPS + age replaces the old Ansible Vault workflow; the Tailscale auth/ACL
keys remain vaulted until expiry):

```bash
# 1. Generate the age keypair and back it up OFFLINE
age-keygen -o age/keys.txt
# 2. Replace the age1<PLACEHOLDER> recipient in .sops.yaml with your public key
# 3. Create + fill + encrypt the secrets file
make sops-init
make sops-encrypt
```

### Deploy

```bash
make check-toolchain
make deploy-hardening
make deploy-engine
make deploy-edge BACKEND=caddy TARGET=<brain>
make deploy-portainer
make run PLAYBOOK=playbooks/l3/stack.yml TAGS='l3-observability,stack'
```

> **Note:** The canonical command surface lives in [docs/operations/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md](docs/operations/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md). Use `make` targets instead of raw playbook calls when possible.

---

## Operations with Make

Make is the official command interface for this project. Day-to-day operations should run through Make targets.

### High-frequency operator commands

```bash
make help
make sync
make install-collections
make check-toolchain
make deploy-hardening
make deploy-engine
make deploy-edge BACKEND=caddy TARGET=<brain>
make deploy-portainer
make run PLAYBOOK=playbooks/l3/stack.yml TAGS='l3-observability,stack'
make verify-tailscale
make verify-crowdsec
make verify-observability
```

### Advanced and safety workflows

```bash
make run PLAYBOOK=playbooks/site.yml TAGS='nist,sc-7'
make run PLAYBOOK=playbooks/site.yml SKIP_TAGS='tailscale,vpn'
make deploy-compliance
make nuke CONFIRM=DESTROY_ALL_INFRASTRUCTURE
make audit-full
```

The role structure is intentionally separated so security controls, Docker orchestration, observability, and ingress can evolve independently without coupling the baseline hardening path.

---

## Docker & Deployment

Docker is used for application stacks and observability services, not as the primary automation runtime.

### Deploy Applications

All 8 application profiles (Chatwoot, Metabase, n8n, NocoDB, OpenWebUI, Twenty CRM, Uptime Kuma, FastAPI) deploy as Docker Compose stacks from structured profiles under `apps/`, rendered by the L6 runtime. Compose does not depend on Portainer (ADR-07): with the optional manager enabled (`enable_portainer: true`), the same stacks can be managed through Portainer's UI (Edge agent); with the default `enable_portainer: false`, a compose-only deploy needs zero `portainer_*` variables. See [ARCHITECTURE.md §Application Profiles](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md#application-profiles) for the full schema.

### Security Notes

- Prefer publishing services through the hardened ingress layer instead of exposing broad host ports.
- Use the provided SOPS workflow for sensitive runtime values.
- Application stacks are intended to run behind the project's reverse proxy and network segmentation model.
- App configuration is operator-managed: each app has a pinned `docker-compose.yml` plus a `.env` (template: `apps/<name>/.env.example`). The old Ansible-managed `apps/<name>/vars.yml` was removed (2026-07-31).

---

## Configuration & Secrets

This project does not require a root `.env.example`. Runtime secrets are encrypted with SOPS + age and loaded transparently by the `community.sops` vars plugin from `group_vars/all/secrets.sops.yml` and `group_vars/all/managers/portainer.sops.yml` (the Tailscale auth/ACL keys remain in the Ansible Vault until expiry). Application-specific configuration is operator-managed via `apps/<name>/.env`, templated from `apps/<name>/.env.example`. See [ARCHITECTURE.md §App Profiles](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md#application-profiles) for the profile schema.

### Core Secrets Template

```yaml
# group_vars/all/secrets.yml.example (fill into secrets.sops.yml, then: make sops-encrypt)
vault_github_token: "GITHUB_TOKEN_GOES_HERE"
caddy_acme_email: "ops@example.com"
# Portainer edge keys live in group_vars/all/managers/portainer.sops.yml:
#   portainer_edge_keys_by_node:
#     brain-1: "PORTAINER_EDGE_KEY_FOR_BRAIN_1"
#     muscle-1: "PORTAINER_EDGE_KEY_FOR_MUSCLE_1"
```

### Optional Observability Values

These are required only when the observability stack is enabled:

- `observability_stack_host_ip`
- `observability_grafana_admin_user`
- `observability_grafana_admin_password`
- `observability_grafana_root_url`

### App Configuration

Application variables are managed through the Ansible variable hierarchy (5-tier precedence). Each app has:

- `apps/<name>/docker-compose.yml` - pinned compose stack; env via `apps/<name>/.env.example` (operator-managed)
- `apps/<name>/profile.yml` - metadata (version, DB type, backup schedule, monitoring)

Apps deploy as Compose stacks (optionally managed via Portainer). See [OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md §3](docs/operations/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md) for the full deployment guide.

---

## Validation & Quality Gates

The repository is validated through uv-managed tooling and Ansible-native checks.

```bash
make sync
make install-collections
make check-toolchain
make lint PLAYBOOK=playbooks/site.yml
make precommit-run
```

Current quality gates include:

- YAML formatting validation.
- Ansible playbook syntax checks.
- Role and playbook linting.
- Secret detection with a tracked baseline.

> **Operational note:** `make lint` is intentionally strict and should be used before changes are promoted to shared environments.

---

## 🧪 Tests

This project is validated through Make-driven quality gates. For production-grade role testing, use `molecule` or `ansible-test` with a local inventory:

```bash
make check-toolchain
make lint PLAYBOOK=playbooks/site.yml
make precommit-run
```

**CI pipeline:** All playbooks pass syntax check and linting on every PR via [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/ci.yml). A dedicated `security-audit.yml` workflow runs on version tags for release gating.

> **Note:** Automated role-level integration testing (e.g., Molecule) is on the roadmap. Current validation focuses on syntax, linting, idempotency dry-runs, and secret scanning - all exercised through `make` targets and CI.
