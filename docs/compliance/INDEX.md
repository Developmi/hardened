# Compliance Index | Developmi Hardened

This index directs to the compliance framework documentation and mappings for the Developmi Hardened.

---

## 1. Master Compliance Status

The Single Source of Truth for all framework mappings, control definitions, and evidence verification procedures is:

> 📘 **[COMPLIANCE-MAPPING-STATUS.md](COMPLIANCE-MAPPING-STATUS.md)**

Please refer to that document for the complete coverage matrix and implementation status of **NIST SP 800-53**, **NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust)**, **CIS Benchmarks**, **DORA**, **ENS**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, and **SOC 2 Type II**.

## 2. Documentation Structure

Following the consolidation of framework indices, the compliance documentation layout is organized as follows:

```
docs/compliance/
├── INDEX.md                     ← This file (entry directory)
├── COMPLIANCE-MAPPING-STATUS.md  ← Master framework mappings and status
├── NIST/
│   ├── NIST_800_53.md           ← Control → Role → Evidence traceability details
│   └── NIST_800_171.md          ← Controlled Unclassified Information mapping (TBD)
├── DORA/                        ← DORA evidence artifacts
├── ENS/                         ← ENS evidence artifacts
├── SOC2/                        ← SOC 2 evidence artifacts
└── evidence/
    ├── EVIDENCE_MODEL.md        ← Evidence collection triggers, format, storage, and retention
    └── PRODUCTION_ACCEPTANCE.md ← Production acceptance gates and verification criteria
```

The folders `NIST/`, `DORA/`, `ENS/`, and `SOC2/` are reserved exclusively for storing compliance evidence artifacts (e.g., `EVIDENCE_MODEL.md` or generated reports), with all narrative framework indexes consolidated into the master file.
