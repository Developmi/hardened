## Owner Responsibilities

Every documentation artifact in the Developmi Hardened has an assigned owner (documented in `.github/CODEOWNERS`) responsible for its accuracy, review cadence, and lifecycle.

1. **Accuracy**: The owner ensures the document's technical content is correct and aligned with the current implementation.
2. **Review**: The owner reviews the document at the specified cadence and updates the `last-reviewed` date in its frontmatter.
3. **Lifecycle**: The owner decides when a document is deprecated, archived, or superseded.
4. **Cross-References**: The owner ensures related documents and cross-references are updated when content changes.
