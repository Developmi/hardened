# Developer Onboarding - Developmi Hardened v6.0.0

5-step developer setup sequence to go from zero to running your first Ansible playbook.

---

## Prerequisites

| Component        | Version                                       | Installation                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Python**       | 3.14+                                         | `apt install python3.14` or via `pyenv`            |
| **uv**           | latest stable                                 | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |
| **ansible-core** | 2.21.1 (pinned)                               | `uv pip install ansible-core==2.21.1`              |
| **Git**          | 2.40+                                         | `apt install git`                                  |
| **OS**           | Linux (Debian 12 or Ubuntu 22.04 recommended) | -                                                  |

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Developmi/hardened.git
cd stack
```

---

## Step 2: Install Toolchain Dependencies

```bash
# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv sync

# Verify ansible-core version (must be 2.21.1)
ansible --version | head -1
# Expected: ansible [core 2.21.1]

# Install Ansible collections
make install-collections
```

---

## Step 3: Set Up Secrets (SOPS + age)

```bash
# Copy the SOPS sample and encrypt it with your age key
cp inventory/group_vars/all/secrets.sops.yml.example inventory/group_vars/all/secrets.sops.yml
make sops-encrypt

# Verify secrets are readable
make sops-view
```

> ⚠️ The `.gitignore` excludes `*.sops.yml`. Never commit plaintext secrets. The only vaulted exception is the Tailscale trio (`inventory/group_vars/all/secrets.yml`), retired at gate D4 (OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK §7.4).

---

## Step 4: Run Your First Playbook

```bash
# Full deploy (OS baseline + compliance hardening)
make deploy
# OR
ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml
```

For a minimal test on a single host:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml \
  --limit <target-host> \
  --check --diff
```

---

## Step 5: Verification

After deployment, verify the hardening was applied:

```bash
# SSH hardening
ssh -o PasswordAuthentication=no root@<target-host> 2>&1 | grep -q "Permission denied" && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL"

# Firewall status (Debian 12)
ssh <target-host> "sudo nft list ruleset | head -5"
# Expected: ruleset with standard chains

# Firewall status (Ubuntu 22.04)
ssh <target-host> "sudo ufw status verbose | grep 'Status: active'"

# Compliance evidence
ssh <target-host> "ls /srv/evidence/nist/ac-2/"
# Expected: timestamped evidence files

# System hardening
ssh <target-host> "sysctl kernel.kptr_restrict"
# Expected: 2 (restricted)
```

## Common Issues

| Issue                           | Resolution                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ansible-core` version mismatch | `uv pip install ansible-core==2.21.1 --force-reinstall`              |
| SOPS age key not found          | Ensure `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` exists (see Step 3)             |
| SSH connection refused          | Target host must have SSH enabled. Verify with `ssh <host> echo ok`  |
| `uv sync` fails on ARM64        | ARM64 is fully supported. Ensure Python 3.14+ is installed for ARM64 |
