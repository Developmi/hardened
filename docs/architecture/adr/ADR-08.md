## Context

Originally, backup responsibilities were split across three Ansible roles:

- `roles/backup/` - handled app-data backups (L5)
- `roles/stack_backup/` - handled runtime-state backups (L6)
- `roles/backup-timers/` - handled cron-based backup scheduling

This separation was motivated by layer purity: L5 (apps) should not know about L6 (runtime) internals.

## Decision (Superseded)

The original decision to separate backup roles was superseded by the layer-refactor. All three roles are now consolidated into a single role at `roles/L6_runtime/backup/`, with source selection controlled by the `backup_role_source` variable at the playbook level.

## Why Consolidated

- The separation added maintenance burden without proportional benefit
- Three roles shared overlapping logic (borg/restic invocation, retention policies, cron scheduling)
- The layer purity concern is now handled at the VARIABLE level (`backup_role_source`), not the role level
- Single source of truth for backup configuration, easier to audit and debug

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Simpler maintenance, single set of defaults, unified testing surface
- **Negative**: Role is larger (~40 files). `backup_role_source` must be set correctly per playbook invocation
- **Migration**: Playbooks `backup-l5.yml` and `backup-timers.yml` both reference `roles/L6_runtime/backup/` with different `backup_role_source` values
