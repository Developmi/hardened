# Documentation Index

This folder centralizes project documentation by objective and operational domain.

---

## Quick Start

The Developmi Hardened is an enterprise-grade Ansible hardening framework for NIST-aligned Debian and Ubuntu infrastructure. If you're new:

- **I want to run this suite** → Start with the [root README](../README.md), then [OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md](operations/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md)
- **I want to contribute** → Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **I maintain this project** → Start with [PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md](project/PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md)
- **I need to understand the architecture** → Start with [ARCHITECTURE.md](architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **How are applications managed?** → Application state and deployment (L5) are completely agnostic. Developers can manage their apps via Portainer, raw Docker Compose via SSH, or future orchestrators (Swarm, K8s, K3s).

For all available documentation, see the directory listing below.
