# FinOps Baseline

## Overview

This document tracks cost estimation and financial governance across the Developmi Hardened.
It establishes a per-node cost baseline for OpenSource-scoped layers (L1–L6), documents the
boundary with private cloud provisioning costs (L0), and references the Nuntu field case study
for aggregate OpEx comparison.

**Scope rule:** L0 cloud provisioning costs are private and explicitly excluded from this
OpenSource repository. L1–L6 compute resource costs are estimated here using generic
VPS/bare-metal equivalent tiers.

## L0 vs L1–L6 Cost Separation

> Source: [ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) §5 - 7-Layer Architecture Model

| Layer | Name             | Cost Responsibility                                                                                            | Scope                      |
| ----- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| L0    | Commercial Infra | Cloud provisioning (OpenTofu), compute instances, block storage, DNS zones, provider-specific security groups. | **Private - out of scope** |
| L1    | OS Baseline      | Package manager, update/hold policies, auto-upgrade checker, architecture detection.                           | OpenSource                 |
| L2    | Compliance       | SSH hardening, firewall (ufw/nftables), fail2ban, kernel hardening, CrowdSec, NIST/CIS evidence collection.    | OpenSource                 |
| L3    | Observability    | VictoriaMetrics, Grafana, Loki, scrape targets, health endpoints, alerting rules.                              | OpenSource                 |
| L4    | Networking/Edge  | Caddy reverse proxy, TLS certificate management, WAF profiles, Caddy logging.                                  | OpenSource                 |
| L5    | App Profiles     | YAML profile schema, compose templates, app vars/secrets, backup schedules and retention.                      | OpenSource                 |
| L6    | Runtime Adapters | Docker Engine, compose rendering/deploy, Portainer BE (optional), runtime-state backups.                       | OpenSource                 |

**Trust boundary:** L1–L6 are OpenSource. L0 is private/commercial, never referenced with
implementation details in this repository. Cost estimates for L1–L6 use VPS-equivalent
tiers only - no cloud provider pricing, contract rates, or region-specific SKUs are documented.

## Per-Node Cost Baseline

> Source: [ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) §7 - Host Classes (brain/muscle/local)

Estimated monthly cost ranges based on generic VPS/bare-metal equivalent tiers. Actual costs
depend on provider, region, committed use, and workload density - these are planning estimates,
not quotes.

| Node Type  | Role                 | Resources (guideline)            | Est. Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **brain**  | Management node      | 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 80 GB SSD      | $20–$40                 | Moderate CPU. Runs Portainer, Grafana, ingress, backups, evidence collection. Persistent storage required.                |
| **muscle** | Compute worker       | 8 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, 160 GB SSD    | $40–$80                 | Higher CPU/RAM for application workloads. Runs Chatwoot, n8n, Twenty CRM, Metabase, etc. Persistent storage for app data. |
| **local**  | Operator workstation | Variable (1–8 vCPU, 4–16 GB RAM) | $0 (bring-your-own)     | Workstation-grade hardening. No observability, no backups. Tailscale manual auth. Operator-provided hardware.             |

**Cost drivers per layer** (additive on top of base node):

| Layer | What adds cost                                                                | Cost driver type    |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| L1    | None - package manager and update policies are CPU-idle background tasks.     | Negligible          |
| L2    | CrowdSec (lightweight agent). fail2ban (minimum CPU).                         | Negligible          |
| L3    | VictoriaMetrics (TSDB storage), Grafana (dashboards), Loki (log storage).     | Storage + RAM       |
| L4    | Caddy (lightweight, Go-compiled). WAF profiles (minimal overhead).            | Negligible          |
| L5    | App containers (PostgreSQL, Redis, app runtimes). Backup storage (retention). | CPU + RAM + Storage |
| L6    | Docker Engine (runtime overhead). Portainer BE (optional, ~256 MB RAM).       | Light               |

**Scaling model:** brain nodes scale 1 per platform (or ≥2 for HA). Muscle nodes scale
horizontally - add more as application workload grows. Local nodes are operator-provided
and incur no platform cost.

| Metric                 | Before (SaaS Sprawl) | After (Sovereign Self-Hosted)  | Impact                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Annual Software OpEx   | $X (baseline)        | $0.3X                          | **-70%**                   |
| Platform Uptime (Prod) | ~99.5%               | 99.8%                          | Higher reliability         |
| Data Sovereignty       | 0%                   | 100%                           | Full control               |
| WAF Efficacy           | N/A                  | >99% block, <1% false positive | Enterprise-grade perimeter |
| Incident Response Time | Hours/Days           | Minutes                        | Stronger resilience        |
| Vendor Risk            | Critical             | Negligible                     | Supply-chain risk reduced  |

This is a field implementation narrative, not a vendor benchmark. Results depend on workload,
architecture, and governance discipline.

## Updating This Baseline

Update this document when any of the following occur:

1. **New node type** is introduced beyond brain/muscle/local.
2. **Provider change** shifts the VPS-equivalent pricing tiers (e.g., ARM64 Ampere nodes change the cost floor).
3. **Significant price change** in the self-hosted stack components (Docker, Caddy, PostgreSQL, etc.).
4. **New layer** or role added that materially affects compute, storage, or network cost.
5. **Case study refresh** - new field data from additional migrations or expanded Nuntu fleet.

To update:

- Adjust the per-node cost table with current planning estimates.
- Add a dated entry to the changelog below.
- If the case study section changes, sync with the root [README.md](../../README.md) FinOps Case Study section.
